<div align="center">Greater than 40% of our popluation (3 billion) rely on polluting and unhealthy fuels for cooking <a href="references.html">[1]</a>. These fuels are described as dirty energy, however, what is dirty energy? Why makes it dirty?</div>

<h1 align="center">Dirty Energy</h1>
<div align="justify">Dirty energy is the usuage or production of energy that either presents harm to our enviromnet or our person. Non-renewable resources &#8212;
 a natural resource in which we cannot readily replace by natural means &#8212; such as fossil fuels &#8212; a natural fuel such as coal or gas, formed by decomposed plants and other organisms buried beneath layers of sediemnt and rock in the geological past &#8212; are typically the center of attention when it comes to a discussion of dirty energy. 

<br><br>Fossil fuels, such as petroleum, oil, and coal, are combusted in order to provide energy. However, harmful byproducts such as <b>carbon-monoxide</b> and <b>carbon-dioxide</b> arise through the consumption of fossil fuels.<br><br>

Carbon-monoxide can contribute to carbon monoxide poision which is caused by inhaling combustion fumes. "When too much carbon monoxide is in the air you're breathing, your body replaces the oxygen in your red blood cells with carbon monoxide. This prevents oxygen from reaching your tissues and organs." <a href="references.html">[2]</a>. Depending on how long are you are exposed to carbon-monoxide, and how much carbon-monoxide you are exposed to. Compilcations can involve <a href="references.html">[2]</a><br><br>
	&emsp;<div style="margin-left:16px" align="justify">&bullet; Permanent brain damage</div><br>
	&emsp;<div style="margin-left:16px" align="justify">&bullet; Damage to your heart, possibly leading to life-threatening cardiac complications</div><br>
	&emsp;<div style="margin-left:16px" align="justify">&bullet; Fetal death or miscarriage</div><br>
	&emsp;<div style="margin-left:16px" align="justify">&bullet; Death</div><br><br>
Risk factors include <a href="references.html">[2]</a><br><br>
	&emsp;<div style="margin-left:16px" align="justify">&bullet;Unborn babies in which fetal blood cells, that take up carbon monoxide more readily than adult blood cells do, are more susecptible to harm from carbon monoxide poisoning</div><br>
	&emsp;<div style="margin-left:16px;" align="justify">&bullet;Young children, who take breaths more frequently than adults, can lead to them being more susecptible to carbon monoxide poisoning</div><br>
	&emsp;<div style="margin-left:16px" align="justify">&bullet; People who have chronic heart disease or have a known history of anemia/breathing problems are more likely to get sick from exposure to carbon monoxide</div><br><br>

Carbon-dioxide, though being far less dangerous as supposed to carbon-monoxide &#8212; "the silent killer" <a href="references.html">[3]</a>. Gases such as carbon dioxide are able to absorb infarered radiation and contribute to the greenhouse effect &#8212; A process in which radiation, provided by the sun, from a planet's atmosphere warms the planet's surface by essentially 'trapping the warm of the sun' &#8212; because of this, carbon dioxide is notoriously known as a greenhouse gas.<br><br>

Out of the many concerns of dirty energy, the greenhouse effect that carbon-dioxide contributes to is one of the most important factors.<br></div>

<h1 align="center">Dirty energy and effecting the bigger picture</h1>

<div align="justify">The biggest concern of the greenhouse effect lies in how it relates to global warming &#8212; a gradual increase in the overall temperature of a planet's atmosphere &#8212; Stated by Live Science, "The average global temperature has increased by about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius) over the past 100 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)"<a href="references.html">[4]</a> &#8212; and that, "Despite political controversy about climate change, a major report released Sept. 27, 2013," &#8212; "Scientists are more certain than ever of the link between human activites and global warming." &#8212; "Global warming is real and has been caused by human action."<a href="references.html">[4]</a><br><br>

Fears that arise from global warming revolve around the impact global warming as on earth. One of those fears are the increase in temperature extremes. "While experiencing some of the hottest summers on record," such as the hottest year on record worldwide in 2016, "much of the United States has also been experiencing colder-than-normal-winters" <a href="references.html">[4]</a>. Such changes in climate cause polar jet streams which migrate south and leads to some states having sudden cold snaps.<br><br> 

However, global warming is not limited to only extreme temperatures. Extreme weather, such as hurricanes, even "though this is still a subject of active scientific research, current computer models of the atmosphere indicate that hurricanes are more likely to become less frequent on a global basis, though the hurricanes that do form may be more intense" <a href="references.html">[4]</a> Acorrding to a 2014 study <a href="references.html">[5]</a>, Lightening is another weather feature that is being affected by gobal warming. "A 50% percent increase in the number of lightning strikes within the United States is expected by 2100 if global temperatures continue to rise." &#8212; "A 12% increase in lightning activity for every 1.8 degress F (1 degree of C) of warming in the atmosphere" <a href="references.html">[4]</a>. Projections exists about extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts, blizzards and rainstorms, will occur more often and with greater intensity due to global warming <a href="references.html">[4]</a>. "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)  established the U.S. Climate Extremes Index (CEI) in 1996 to track extreme weather events. The number of extreme weather events that are among the most unusual in the historical record, according to the CEI, has been rising over the last four decades." <a href="references.html">[4]</a><br><br>

Though, one of the primary impacts of climate change is ice melt. "According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, there is now 10% less permafrost, or permanently frozen ground, in the Northern hemisphere" <a href="references.html">[4]</a>. Such thawing of permafrost causes sudden land collapses/landslides. In which long-buried microbes and be released such as "in a 2016 case when a cache of buried reindeer carcasses thawed and caused an outbreak of anthrax" <a href="references.html">[4]</a>. Glacial retreat &#8212; A glacier's snow melting faster than it accumulates &#8212; is as well an obvious effect of global warming. "There is a 99% likelihood that this rapid retreat [Glacial retreat] is due to human-caused climate change. Some glaciers retreated up to 15 times as much as they would have withought global warming" <a href="references.html">[4]</a>. In addition with sea ice meltting due to the arctic warming twice as fast as anywhere on earth <a href="references.html">[6]</a>. There is concern that we will reach a critical point in global warming in which the usual amount sea ice and glaciers &#8212; which would have reflected a lot of sunlight out and back into space <a href="references.html">[7]</a> &#8212; has melted away will cause less reflected sunlight, unfortuanely causing more sunlight being absorbed into the ocean and result in more heat, from the sun, being trapped in our atmosphere and ultimately cause more glacier and ice melt. Essentially a snowball effect in which we would be too late to stop.<br><br></div>

In addition with ice melt, "in 2014, the World Meterological Organization reported that sea-level rise accelerated 0.12 in. (3mm) per year on average worldwide." &#8212; "Double the average annual rise of 0.07 in. (1.6mm) in the 20th century." <a href="references.html">[4]</a> Melting polar ice (in the Artctic and Antarctic regions) in addition with: melting ice sheets and glaciers across Greenland, North America, South America, Europe, and Asia are "all expected to raise sea levels significantly" <a href="references.html">[4]</a> and that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is "at least 95% certain that humans are to blame for warming oceans, rapidly melting ice and rising sea levels" <a href="references.html">[4]</a>. If greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, remain unchecked, "global sea levels could rise by as much as 3 feet (0.9m) by 2100." <a href="references.html">[4]</a>. Fears of rising water include low-lying islands or beaches and having to deal with receeding shore lines or fears of becoming completely submerged <a href="references.html">[8]</a>. Only recently did we experience our first pacific island submerging and talk of our 'first climate refugees' (from said island) "is directly linked to global warming," and, "the rising sea levels" <a href="references.html">[9]</a>. "If current trends continue, many coastal areas, where roughly half of the Earth's human population lives, will be inundated." <a href="references.html">[4]</a>.

However, with all this talk, as levels of C02 increase (through usuage of dirty energy), this gas will dissolve into our oceans, and result in an increase of the acidity. "When you dissolved C02 in water, you get carbonic acid. This is the same exact thing that happens in cans of soda" &#8212; "the pH is 2 &#8212; quite acidic." <a href="references.html">[4]</a> Since the early 1700s, ocean acidity has increased by around 25% <a href="references.html">[4]</a>. "As we add more and more CO2 to the ocean, it gets more and more acidic, dissolving more and more shells of sea creatures." <a href="references.html">[4]</a> Crabs, oysters and urchins need their shells to survive. In some cases, "hatchers have lost 80% of their oyster production." <a href="references.html">[10]</a>. Tiny animals and plants named plankton, the bulding blocks of ocean life, are dissolving from ocean acidifcation. These small animals dying off are resulting in less food for the larger fish and marine mammals, such as Pteropods (suspectible to ocean acidification), make up 60% of pink salmon diet <a href="references.html">[10]</a>. Ultimately, this can lead to our ocean collapsing and this will hurt us all. "More than 1 billion people rely on fisheries as their primary source of protein" <a href="references.html">[10]</a>.<br><br>

 If the acidification trends continue, coral reefs are expected to become increasingly rare and without help <a href="references.html">[10]</a>, by the end of this century, 75% of seawater will be corrosive to many corals and shellfish <a href="references.html">[10]</a>. "1 out of 4 of the world's marine species rely on coral reefs, which also provide food and livelihoods for some 500 million people." <a href="references.html">[10]</a>. <br><br></div>

Ultimately, dirty energy effects the bigger picture</div>
