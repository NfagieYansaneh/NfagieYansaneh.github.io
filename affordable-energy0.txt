"The U.S. has produced more than 1 billion tons of coal annually for each of the last 15 years" &#8212; "Coal is essential to the U.S. economy, providing affordable electricity to households, businesses, manufacturing facilities, transportation and communications systems" etc. <a href="references.html">[14]</a> However, with the progress of technological advancments toward renewable and clean energy, costs for renewable energy are now in a fierce competition with dirty energy such as fossil fuels.

"In 2016, a global renewable energy capacity grew by a record amount while its cost fell considerably." <a href="references.html">[11]</a>, largely do to cheaper costs for solar and wind energy <a href="references.html">[11]</a>.
