Talk of clean energy, renewnable energy, and affordable energy all encorach on questions about how this affects you &#8212; the individual &#8212; the consumer and civilian. It's a very simple yet important question &#8212; How does this affect you?

<h1> Global warming </h1>
As the individual, using dirty energy that contributes to greenhouse gas emissions can seem very little, and yet, the impact is global. As stated before &#8212; Ocean acidification will disrupt the food web. Ocean acidification can damage/destroy coral reefs. "1 out of 4 of the world's marine species rely on coral reefs, which also provide food and livelihoods for some 500 million people" [?]. Whether that doesn't directly affect you, the mass death of plankton, such as pteropods, because of ocean acidification [?] can cause a cuse the ocean food web collasping. "More than 1 billion people rely on fisheries as their primary source of protein." <br><br>

However, maybe you don't rely on fish, but you are located near shores and innocent waters. The impact of greenhouse gasses are still global. "In general, as ice melts, sea levels rise. In 2014, the World Meteorological Organization reported that sea-level rise accelerated 0.12 inches (3 millimeters) per year on average worldwide." [?] and the world is taking notice. Only recently did we experience our first pacific island submerging [?] and had our first climate refugees [?]. In some situations, individuals combat this by "Raftlike homes and buoyant buildings" [?]. melting ice sheets and glaciers across Greenland, North America, South America, Europe, and Asia are "all expected to raise sea levels significantly" [?]. Such things now have to be considered when planning a house or a place to live. Whether you value the scenary or are concerned of submergance.<br><br>

However, it is entirely plausible that this doesn't effect you. Yet, even if you live inland, the impact of greenhouse gasses are still global. With the increase in average temperatures & temperature extremes [?]. Changes in climate can cause polar jet streams, in some states, this has lead to sudden cold snaps or colder than-normal winters [?]. Although, there is more to this, "Scientists project that extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts, blizzards and rainstorms will continue to occur more often and with greater intensity due to global warming" [?] A 2014 study expects a 50% increase in the number of lightning strike in the United states by 2100 [?] and computer models of the atmosphere indicate that "hurricanes are more likely to become less frequent on a global basis, though the hurricanes that do form may be more intesnse". "the strongest hurricanes in the present climate may be upstaged by even more intense hurricanes over the next century as the Earth's climate is warmed by increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere" [?]. <br><br>

So whether where you lay, as long as you are on earth and just like the rest, human. The impact of greenhouse gases will impact you has global warming is a global event.
