Stated in Clean Energy (Hyperlink), clean energy does not bear the consequences in global warming. So much so that the "EPA found that health benefits of clean energy can outweigh the cost of the technology in some cases. If all of the benefits of clean energy were put together, the benefits of clean energy might outweigh the costs in all cases" <a href="references.html">[11]</a>. In combination with solar photovoltaics (PV) &#8212; a means of harnassing sunlight (solar radiation) into direct current electricity by using semiconductors &#8212; costs droping by 82% over 2010-2019 <a href="references.html">[11]</a>. There is more and more of an incentive to take advantage of using clean energy as once you've paid the costs of installing a renewable energy system, "you can become less reliant on the National Grid and your energy bills can be reduced." <a href="references.html">[11]</a> In some cases, you can even get paid for producing such energy. "The UK Government's Feed-in Tariff pays you for the electricity you generate, even if you use it." <a href="references.html">[11]</a>. Potentially allowing you to 'sell' electricity back to the grid. "If you are generating eneough energy to export an excess back into the National Grid, you can receive an additional payment from the Feed-in Tariff scheme" <a href="references.html">[11]</a>. However, this is not only limited to the UK. Other countries, such as NZ, feature the 'reselling' of renewable energy. "To enable you to sell any surplus energy back to the grid, you need a special import/export meter installed" Stated by NZ company, Contact Energy<a href="references.html">[19]</a>. As well as, obviously, reducing your carbon footprint. The typical solar PV system can save about 1.5 - 2 tonnes of carbon per year <a href="references.html">[11]</a> whilst the "average home can save between $10,000 and $30,000 over the lifetime of your solar panel system" <a href="references.html">[19]</a>. <br><br>

In the case you are interested into setting up your own solar panels, its best to contact or check out your electricity provider. Although, in some cases, websites such as project sunroof (Only in America as currently) seek to quicken this procedure by establishing profit margins and such from your geographical location or where in particular you place your solar panels.
