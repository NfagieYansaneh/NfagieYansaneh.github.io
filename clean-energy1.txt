<div align="center">As of 2015, more than 20% of power was generated through renewable sources, yet, why is this of any importance? Non-renewable sources are cheaper [?], yet, why is there a commotion about a push for renewable sources &#8212; for renewable energy &#8212; for clean energy?</div>
<h1 align="center">Clean Energy</h1>
<div align="justfiy">Clean energy is typically, or analogous to, renewable energy. Renewable energy is from natural sources or such, in which they are constantly replenished. Renewable energy can involve<br><br>
&emsp;&bullet; Solar energy<br>
<div style="margin-left:48px" align="justify">Of all the types of renewable energy, sunlight is one of the most abudant and freely avaiable. "The amount of solar energy that reaches the earth's surface in one hour is more than the planet's total energy requirements for a whole year" [?]. However, the amount of solar energy we can use varies with time, season, and geographical location. According to [?], solar energy is becoming a popular method in order to supply their energy usuage.</div><br><br>
&emsp;&bullet; Wind energy<br>
<div style="margin-left:48px" align="justify">As well solar energy, wind energy is another plentiful source of clean energy. While "wind farms are increasingly familiar sight in the UK with wind power making an ever-increasing contribution to the National Grid," they also present the same occurring issues with solar energy &#8212; wind energy can vary with time, season, and geographical location. In order to harness this wind energy, turbines drive generators that then supply energy towards the National Grid. <font color="red">DEFINE THE NATIONAL GRID</font></div><br><br>
&emsp;&bullet; Hydro energy<br>
<div style="margin-left:48px" align="justify"> Out of all of the renewable energy resources, "Hydro power is one of the most commercially developed" [?]. A large reservoir's folow of water can be controlled via a dam/barrier in a manner to drive a turbine, producing electrical energy. This energy source "can often be more reliable than solar or wind power (especially if it's tidal rather than river) and also allows electricity to be stored for use when demand reaches a peak" [?]. Much like the previously stated renewable energy sources &#8212; hydro energy can vary with geographical location.</div><br><br>
&emsp;&bullet; Tidal energy<br>
<div style="margin-left:48px" align="justify">Similar to hydro energy, tidal energy harnasses power from the twice-daily tidal currents by using the tide to drive turbine gernerators. However, tidal flow is not as consistent to alternative hydro energy sources. On the other hand, "it is highly preditictable" [?]. We can compensate for periods when the tide is low by planning before hand. Tidal currents vary with time and geological location.</div><br><br> 
&emsp;&bullet; Geothermal energy<br>
<div style="margin-left:48px" align="justify">By taking advantage of the natural heat below the earth's surface, we can produce geothermal energy. Althought, geothermal energy, can vary with geographical location. "Geothermal energy is of negligible importance in the UK compared to countries such as Iceland, where geothermal heat is much more freely available"[?]</div><br><br>
&emsp;&bullet; Biomass energy<br>
<div style="margin-left:48px" align="justify">Biomass energy consists of converting solid fuel, made from plant materials, into electricity. Although, biomass energy involves the burning of organic materials to produce electricity, this does not include wood, instead, "nowadays this is a much cleaner, more energy-efficient process" &#8212; "By converting agricultural, industrial and domestic waste into solid, liquid and gas fuel, bio mass generates power at a much lower economical and environmental cost."

<h1 align="center">Clean energy v. Dirty energy</h1>
<div align="justify">Because of the methods and processes involving the development and consumption of clean energy, this form of energy does not bare the overhelming consequences of dirty energy, or the greenhouse gases produced as a result, nor large-scale, 'bigger-picture' situations such as global warming. Another important advantage of clean energy is in how it does not present pollution &#8212; the presence in or introduction into the environment of a substance which has harmful or poisonous effects &#8212; so much so that in July 2019, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released their "Public Health Benefits per kWh of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy in the United States" report as a way to "help state and local government policymakers and other stakeholders estimate the monetized public health benefits of investments in  energy efficiency and renewable energy" [?]. The EPA were able to develop a "benefits per kilowatt-hour" (BPK), which are reported in cents per kilowatt hour. Stated by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, EPA developed these final figures by:<br><br>

<div style="margin-left:16px" align="justify">1. Every kilowatt of renewable energy generated displaces a kilowatt of energy from coal or gas that would have been generated at that time</div><br>

<div style="margin-left:16px" align="justify">2. Each displaced kilowatt hour of coal or gas will no longer produce x emissions.</div><br>

<div style="margin-left:16px" align="justify">3. Less emissions will release fewer toxins, improving air quality by y.</div><br>

<div style="margin-left:16px" align="justify">4. Improved air will translate into z fewer hospital visits and deaths.</div><br>

<div style="margin-left:16px" align="justify">5. The EPA divided the value of those reduced hospital visits and deaths by the kilowatt hours of renewable energy generated.</div><br>

"The report factors in the health risks caused by nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and PM2.5. These substances contribute to heart attacks, asthma, and respiratory diseases." [?] However, the report was not conducted state by sate, but instead by ten geographic regions over the area of the 48 contiguous states. The health benefits vary with region for many reasons. Nevertheless, the Institute for Local Self-Reliance was able to model the low estimate scenario &#8212; "health benefits of clean energy make up anywhere between 3% and 29% of the cost of electricity for residential customers" [?] &#8212; and the high estimate scenario &#8212; "health benefits of clean energy make up anywhere between 6% and 65% &#8212; <font color="red"> I think i messed up on who actually made this maps </font> seen as so.<br><br>

<font color="green"> Insert high estimate scenario image here </font><br><br>

It should be further noted that EPA's study had ignored the negative health effects from fossil fuesl which multiply as more dirty energy is generated. The EPA acknowledges the exclusion of negative health effects of carbon dioxide (ex, vector-borne diseases) which meanes that the "benefits per kilowatt hour" of renewable energy is underestimated. "EPA found that health benefits of clean energy can outweigh the cost of the technology in some cases. If all of the benefits of clean energy were put together, the benefits of clean energy might outweigh the costs in all cases" [?]
